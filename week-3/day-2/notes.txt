lambda()
    An anonymous in-line function that acts as a one-time use function.
    Written as "(keyword lambda) (one or more inputs) (colon) (function to be executed)"
    Instead of looking more pythonic - allows you to view it in a more algebraic way

Map
    The map function allows you to iterate over an entire list while running a function on each item of the list. This is why the map function works well with lambda's, because it simplifies things and you write less lines of code.
    The syntax for a map function is "map(function to be used, list to be used)"
    However, you must be careful, as the map function returns a map object, not a list. To turn it into a list we use the list() type conversion.
    Map functions return a Map Object - so you must wrap them in a list() to get values returned
