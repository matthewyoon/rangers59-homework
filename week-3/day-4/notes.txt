.copy is for lists
[:] will make a copy of a string

class collections
    Counter

counter(w.split(' '))

dictionaries are unordered by nature. Must sort string before putting it through a function to create a dictionary
Time Complexity:
Checking for membership in a list is linear
Checking for membership in a dict or set is constant
O is for worst case
theta for average case
omega for best case

enumerate built in function

LINKED LISTS
Singly linked lists

Each item within a linked lists is called a node.
Create a bunch of nodes in unrelated memory slots but have them linked in a certain order

Why beneficial?
Arrays need consecutive memory locations. They need to be next to each other

Linked lists - memory slots don't need to be next to each other. very memory efficient
Disadvantage - finding or adding to the list requires traversing the entire list - linear operation
    We can only start at the head of the linked list.
