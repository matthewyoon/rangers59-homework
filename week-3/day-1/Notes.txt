Regex

Allows you to search through large strings or files.
We can tell python to search through a file or string and say that we want it
to search for a very specific thing.

REGEX doesn't come with python so you need to "import re"

re.compile() = compile, pre determines the string to be used in regular expression methods

re.match() = Returns a regex object, a span and a match. 
    Span is how we can access what we're looking for inside of the string
match.span = tuple
Match is good if you're looking for a specific instance of something but it
will only give you the first instance of where that match occurs.

re.findall() = allows us to look for any instance
will return a list of all matches whereas a match will return just a single first match item and its span

re.search() = Will scan through the string looking for a match.
Will return a match object or none 
search and match do the same thing but match will be a bit quicker because
it is looking for the first match in the string.

Dont need to be specific like 'abcd' to match you can look for a wider range

{} - Will count the number of occurences not a dict

? will allow us to search for something that occurs 0 or 1 time. 

* will note that whatever char is an optional character

+- will note a char that occurs at least once. A more narrow search than *

Unicode = how char are stored in a computer

Raw String (r'') = tells python to interpret something literally
anything thats passed through python as an rstring will be passed as exactly that
\n won't create a new line, python will actually include it as part of the string
