SQL day-4
Stored Procedures/Functions
Something that we need to do repeatedly

EX: Late fees at blockbuster
LANGUAGE plpgsql - allows us to set parameters. more lenient

Can create it once so you can use it repeatedly - can get rid of a stored procedure by using DROP

Difference between function and procedure
Return something or nothing - similar to a python function
