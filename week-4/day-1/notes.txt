SQL

LIKE is created the same way as "=" but the LIKE clause is more powerful than =

= is standard if you want to find something exact

You can add wild cards to the LIKE clause or certain values
% = wildcard

We can also limit the amount of characters using "_" if we want the letter K with 2 characters: LIKE "K__";
Can combine wildcard and underscore symbols
if you add a character that you want at the end of your search, you can limit the number of characters as well as specify what you want

Start with the SELECT * and FROM which part of the data you'd like to see what's actually in your database/data

when using greater or less than try to use the same format as the table

DISTINCT keyword allows you to find non-duplicates
