JOINS

Venn Diagram ex
Left Joins, Right Joins, Inner Joins

Left Join:
    Info that is the same or found for both and things that are on the left table
    Sometimes, will use the WHERE clause to denote where things are empty.
    Give us results that are empty - WHERE B.key is NULL

Right Join:
    Same as left join but only data that is intersected will be selected

Inner Join:
    Intersected data from both tables but not anything that is only in one table

Outer Join:
    Everything.
